This folder imitates the structure of the backend but wants to enable easy frontend development.

Stylesheets, Fonts, JavaScripts and images are found in the respective folders.

The HTML files are separated in individual folders




JAVASCRIPT

The whole code was designed and written in an object-oriented manner.
All different semantic parts have been separated and encapsulated into different Modules which offer required global functions in APIs to keep the global scope clean and manage a clear structure
All of the Modules are encapsulated inside a function, which gets executed after the DOM has been fully created.
Beware of the order the different Modules were included, as Modules which offer required functions need to be included before the dependant Modules. See Dependencies Section for further information.
